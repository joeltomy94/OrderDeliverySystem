# OrderDeliverySystem
The Portal hosts a website for customers to search and select products, and place orders. They have a delivery system to ship orders from their warehouse to the customerâ€™s doorstep.

The project mimics an order delivery from warehouse to the destination city. Every destination has a
fixed delivery route , for each delivery type ( normal or premium ), from the central warehouse.
There are several types of dispatch between centers:

Truck
Train
Flight
Boat
Ship
